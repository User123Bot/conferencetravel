      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>
        Academic conferences are integral to the progression of human knowledge,
        combining the world's greatest minds in a continual pursuit to advance
        academic communities all over the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, global conferences are inherently costly to the environment,
        with millions of miles of air travel accumulated each year.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mission of the Conference Travel Emissions Tool (CTET) is to address
        this issue and provide conference hosts with emissions considerate
        solutions.
