## Project Overview
In the face of mounting concerns over environmental sustainability, the Travel Impact Tool emerges as a pivotal tool designed to mitigate the carbon footprint associated with travelling to conferences. Recognising the significant contribution of air travel to global carbon emissions, particularly within the academic sector, the Travel Impact Tool offers a comprehensive solution aimed at empowering conference organisers with the ability to assess and optimise the ecological impact of their events. By implementing a strong algorithm within an intuitive and user-friendly webpage, the Travel Impact Tool facilitates the calculation of total CO2 emissions generated by participants' travel, considering their diverse points of origin. Thus, aiding strategic planning of conference locations but also aligning with the growing demand for responsible event organisation.
