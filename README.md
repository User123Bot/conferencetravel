# ANU TechLauncher - Travel Emissions Tool

Project Landing Page: [Travel Emissions Tool - Landing Page](https://co2indexanu.wixsite.com/travel-emission-tool)

## Project Overview

In the face of mounting concerns over environmental sustainability, the Travel Emissions Tool emerges as a pivotal tool designed to mitigate the carbon footprint associated with travelling to conferences. Recognising the significant contribution of air travel to global carbon emissions, the Travel Emissions Tool offers a comprehensive solution aimed at empowering conference organisers with the ability to assess and optimise the ecological impact of their events. By implementing a strong algorithm within an intuitive and user-friendly webpage, the Travel Emissions Tool facilitates the calculation of CO2 emissions generated by conference participants' travel, considering their diverse points of origin. Thus, aiding strategic planning of conference locations but also aligning with the growing demand for responsible event organisation.

### Problematisation Summary

The core issue revolves around the traditional model of conferences, which necessitates physical attendance, fostering extensive travel and its associated high carbon footprint. This practice not only contributes significantly to environmental degradation but also perpetuates disparities by favouring those who may be able to afford travel costs, potentially excluding valuable contributions from less affluent participants.

The introduction of the Travel Emissions Tool aims to mitigate these environmental impacts by enabling assessments of travel-related carbon emissions and encouraging the conference hosts/organisers to reconsider conference locations and modes based environmental impact. However, this tool's effectiveness is contingent upon accurate data collection across variable factors (e.g., transport mode, distance, fuel used etc.) and the conference communitys' readiness to embrace change, which may be hindered by institutional inertia and traditional preferences for fixed conference venues.

## Repository Walkthrough

`CTET_Project/`

The root directory of the project. It's the main container for the Django project.


`CTET/`

Actual python package for the project. It is where the settings and main configurations live.

* `init.py`: An empty file that tells python that this directory should be treated as a Python package.
* `asgi.py`: Provides an entry point for ASGI-compatible web servers to serve CTET, useful for asynchronous functionality. Doesn't concern the project too much at this stage.
* `settings.py`: Contains all the configuration for the project, including database settings, security keys, and applications config. Will be used as we progress.
* `urls.py`: Defines the URL declarations for the project; this where we "wire" our `views` to URLs.
* `wsgi.py`: Provides an entry point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve our project, essentially used for deployment. 

As you can see, `CTET/` is an important directory but we will not utilise it much - other than for config.


`CTET_Web/`

This is the actual app for our project. This is where we will develop features specific to our website.

* `migrations/`: This directory contains database migration files - they are auto-generated by Django and track changes to our models over time. Will not be used till database integration.
* `templates/`: This directory stores the HTML template files for the website. 
* `admin.py`: This file is used to register our models to the Django admin interface.
* `apps.py`: Configuration file for the app itself.
* `models.py`: Defines our database models (the layout of the database).
* `tests.py`: Contains test classes and functions to test CTET.
* `urls.py`: Local URL declarations for the app; it's used to route different URL patterns to their appropriate view functions.
* `views.py`: Contains view functions that handle requests and return responses.


`manage.py` 

A command-line utility that allows us to interact with the Django project in various ways. For example, you can use it to run the development server, sync the database and for running tests.


#### For the Developers:

When coding, you'll spend most of your time in `views.py` for writing your application logic, `models.py` for defining our data schema, and within the `templates` and `static` directories (which we will need to create) for CTET's 'front-end files (HTML, CSS, JS). The `urls.py` files in both the project and app directories will need to be edited to define the URL patterns for CTET site.

Developers, please view the `dev_installation.md` for instructions.
