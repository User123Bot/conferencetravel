## Project Overview
In the face of mounting concerns over environmental sustainability, the Travel Impact Tool emerges as a pivotal tool designed to mitigate the carbon footprint associated with travelling to conferences. Recognising the significant contribution of air travel to global carbon emissions, particularly within the academic sector, the Travel Impact Tool offers a comprehensive solution aimed at empowering conference organisers with the ability to assess and optimise the ecological impact of their events. By implementing a strong algorithm within an intuitive and user-friendly webpage, the Travel Impact Tool facilitates the calculation of total CO2 emissions generated by participants' travel, considering their diverse points of origin. Thus, aiding strategic planning of conference locations but also aligning with the growing demand for responsible event organisation.

### Problematisation Summary
The core issue revolves around the traditional model of conferences, which necessitates physical attendance, fostering extensive travel and its associated high carbon footprint. This practice not only contributes significantly to environmental degradation but also perpetuates disparities by favouring those who may be able to afford travel costs, potentially excluding valuable contributions from less affluent participants.

The introduction of the Travel Impact Tool aims to mitigate these environmental impacts by enabling assessments of travel-related carbon emissions and encouraging the conference hosts/organisers to reconsider conference locations and modes based environmental impact. However, this tool's effectiveness is contingent upon accurate data collection across variable factors (e.g., transport mode, distance, fuel used etc.) and the conference communitys' readiness to embrace change, which may be hindered by institutional inertia and traditional preferences for fixed conference venues.
